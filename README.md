# Horiseon-Refactor


## Description

For this project, the original code contained many genaric div elements in HTML which required many class selectors in CSS. By changing those div elements to more sematic elements, I was able to eliminate a lot of the class selectors and change them to element selectors in CSS. The original code was missing alternative text for the images, so I added that to the HTML. One of the links was not working because it didn't have an id associated with the link, so I added an id to the HTML. Since I made the elements more sematic, I was able to consolidate the CSS even more by by deleteting unnesessary parent elements. There were many classes that had the exact same styling, so I was able to consolidate them and just use a couple classed throughout the page. 
I learned that by using semantic elements, it makes the code easier to read and structure. By looking closer at the class selectors I was able to see what they were doing and how to use them better.
